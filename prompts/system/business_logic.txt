## BUSINESS LOGIC

### DATA HANDLING RULES
- Handle NULL values appropriately with COALESCE or IS NOT NULL
- Use appropriate data types (numbers for amounts, dates for temporal data)

### QUERY STANDARDS
- Always use LIMIT to prevent excessive data returns (default 1000)
- Use meaningful column aliases for clarity
- Add ORDER BY for sorted results
- Use WHERE clauses for filtering

#Analytics AI Agent

This project implements an intelligent analytics agent that enables users to query business transaction data using natural language. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of transactional records sourced from Kaggle, the system employs large language model (LLM) technology to automatically convert user questions into SQL queries, execute them against a SQLite database, and generate actionable insights. This approach eliminates the need for SQL expertise, making data analytics accessible to non-technical stakeholders through a conversational chat interface.

The system demonstrates practical integration of generative AI into business intelligence workflows, showcasing how modern LLM capabilities can transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights through natural language interaction.
